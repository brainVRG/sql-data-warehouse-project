# Data Catalog for Gold Layer

## Overview
The Gold Layer is the business-level data representation, structured to support analytical and reporting use cases. It consists of **dimension tables** (describing business entities) and **fact tables** (recording business events and metrics) following a Star Schema architecture. 

This layer provides clean, enriched, and standardized data ready for downstream BI tools and ad-hoc analytics.
